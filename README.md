# Argument-mining-scripts

You can find a scrape.py file in the scraping-scripts directory. There is also a csv file containing the case number in the same directory. The script outputs html files named case_no_... and so on.

To run the scripts create a virtual environment as follows:

```
python -m venv env-name
```

Followed by installing from the requirements file:

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Finally navigate to the scraping-scripts directory and run the code using:

```
cd scraping_scripts
python scrape.py
```
